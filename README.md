The library "youtube-dl lib" has been used in this app. 
Now there's a better library to be used called "yt-dlp" that's still 
receiving updates at this time 26/11/2022.

This one was a project for a course of mine called 
"Python applied in industrial environments" so don't expect some kind of
perfection app because you won't get anything. But it still runs and for what
I use for myself it's just enough because it's also related to a project it
needed to be delivered.

So hope you all enjoy and don't criticize me too much for some or another
"basic errors in the pilars of coding"

To execute the code introduce the command:
"python manage.py runserver"
, in the "downloads/" directory (there's the "manage.py" script).

Thank you.

Oh!, and if you see too much libraries installed in the "requirements.txt" file
it's because I use the same virtual environment in other projects and this 
django app results to be here. Still learning for the next time (or if you know
the required libraries that are a MUST, you could install yourself manually :D).

Now it's time, see you in other projects!

Bye.
